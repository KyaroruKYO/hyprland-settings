# Current Project Handoff

## Current Focus

Structured-family review-only per-record editor form foundation on `structured-family-editors-unified`.

## Completed This Sprint

- Added shared structured-family projections for `hl.monitor`, `hl.bind`, `hl.animation`, `hl.curve`, `hl.gesture`, `hl.device`, and `hl.permission`.
- Added review-only Config page cards for all seven families.
- Added fixture parse and fixture render/reread proof for all seven families.
- Added family-specific validators for all seven families.
- Added temp-fixture write plans with path guards for all seven families.
- Added temp-fixture render/reread proof through write plans for all seven families.
- Added review-only per-record editor form projections for all seven families.
- Added disabled per-record editor UI sections with stable family widgets.
- Surfaced raw fallback status for unsupported or not-proven records.
- Added a project-area continuation scan.

## Safety Boundaries

- Real config touched: false.
- Runtime mutated: false.
- `hyprctl reload` run: false.
- Production behavior enabled: false.
- Structured-family writes enabled: false.
- Source/include and duplicate production activation remain capped and separate-phase only.

## Next Exact Work

Add review-only structured-family record edit-state/draft model while keeping real writes blocked.
